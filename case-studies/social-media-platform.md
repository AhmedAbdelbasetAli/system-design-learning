Designing a Social Media Platform
A social media platform allows users to create profiles, connect with others, share content (e.g., posts, images, videos), and interact through likes, comments, and messages. Examples include Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. Designing such a system involves addressing challenges related to scalability, performance, and user experience.

Problem Statement
The goal is to design a scalable and efficient social media platform that supports millions of users. The system should enable users to:

Create profiles and connect with others.
Share posts, images, and videos.
Interact with content through likes, comments, and shares.
Send direct messages to other users.
The platform must handle high traffic volumes while ensuring low latency, high availability, and data consistency.

Functional Requirements
User Management :
Users can create accounts, log in, and update profiles.
Users can follow/unfollow other users.
Content Sharing :
Users can post text, images, and videos.
Posts can be public or private.
Interactions :
Users can like, comment on, and share posts.
Users can send direct messages.
News Feed :
Display a personalized feed of posts from followed users.
Search :
Search for users, posts, or hashtags.
Notifications :
Notify users about likes, comments, and messages.
Non-Functional Requirements
Scalability :
Handle millions of users and billions of interactions daily.
Low Latency :
Ensure fast page loads and real-time updates.
High Availability :
Minimize downtime and ensure reliability.
Data Consistency :
Maintain accurate data across distributed systems.
Security :
Protect user data and prevent abuse (e.g., spam, fake accounts).
High-Level Design
Components:
Web/Mobile App :
Frontend interface for users to interact with the platform.
API Layer :
Exposes endpoints for user management, content sharing, and interactions.
Application Servers :
Handle business logic and process requests.
SQL Database :
Stores structured data like user profiles, posts, likes, and comments.
NoSQL Database :
Stores unstructured data like media files and handles high-throughput workloads.
Caching :
Improves performance by storing frequently accessed data in memory (Redis).
Message Queue :
Handles asynchronous tasks like sending notifications (Kafka/Redis).
Content Delivery Network (CDN) :
Serves static assets (e.g., images, videos) globally via object storage (Amazon S3).
Workflow:
User Registration/Login :
User creates an account or logs in via the API.
Posting Content :
User uploads a post, which is stored in the SQL database and CDN.
News Feed Generation :
The system fetches posts from followed users and displays them in chronological or ranked order.
Interactions :
Users like, comment on, or share posts; these actions are recorded in the SQL database and processed asynchronously for notifications.
Database Design
SQL Database: Structured Data
Schema:
Users Table:
CREATE TABLE users (
    user_id BIGINT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

Follows Table:
CREATE TABLE follows (
    follower_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
    followee_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    PRIMARY KEY (follower_id, followee_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (follower_id) REFERENCES users(user_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (followee_id) REFERENCES users(user_id)
);

Posts Table:
CREATE TABLE posts (
    post_id BIGINT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
    content TEXT,
    media_url VARCHAR(255), -- Points to NoSQL storage (e.g., S3 URL)
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(user_id)
);

Likes Table:
CREATE TABLE likes (
    like_id BIGINT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
    post_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(user_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (post_id) REFERENCES posts(post_id)
);

Comments Table:
CREATE TABLE comments (
    comment_id BIGINT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
    post_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
    content TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(user_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (post_id) REFERENCES posts(post_id)
);

NoSQL Database: Unstructured Data
Media Storage (Amazon S3):
Store images and videos in Amazon S3.
Use a globally distributed CDN to serve media files.
Notifications (Redis/Kafka):
Publish events (e.g., likes, comments) to Redis or Kafka for real-time processing.
Background workers process events and send push notifications.
Search (Elasticsearch):
Index user profiles, posts, and hashtags in Elasticsearch for fast search.
Key Features and Components
1. News Feed Generation
Fetch posts from followed users and sort them by time or relevance.
Use Redis to cache precomputed feeds for active users.
2. Notifications
Use Kafka or Redis to process notifications asynchronously.
Notify users about likes, comments, and new followers.
3. Media Storage
Store images and videos in Amazon S3.
Serve media via a CDN for low-latency delivery.
4. Search
Implement full-text search using Elasticsearch.
Index users, posts, and hashtags for quick retrieval.
Scalability Considerations
Horizontal Scaling :
Deploy multiple instances of application servers behind a load balancer.
Database Sharding :
Shard the SQL database by user ID or region to distribute load.
Caching :
Use Redis to cache frequently accessed data (e.g., user profiles, news feeds).
Asynchronous Processing :
Offload tasks like sending notifications and generating analytics to background workers.
CDN :
Serve static content (e.g., images, videos) from edge locations closer to users.
Trade-offs
Consistency vs. Performance :
Strong consistency ensures accurate data but may slow down writes.
Eventual consistency improves performance but may lead to temporary inconsistencies.
Monolithic vs. Microservices :
A monolithic architecture simplifies development but may become difficult to scale.
Microservices improve scalability but add complexity.
Storage Costs :
Storing large media files increases costs; balancing storage and delivery is critical.
Optimizations
Precompute News Feeds :
Periodically generate and cache news feeds for active users.
Lazy Loading :
Load posts incrementally as users scroll through their feeds.
Compression :
Compress images and videos to reduce storage and bandwidth usage.
Rate Limiting :
Prevent abuse by limiting the number of API requests per user.
Real-World Examples
1. Facebook
Facebook uses a hybrid architecture with sharded SQL databases, caching layers, and CDNs. It also employs machine learning to rank posts in the news feed.

2. Twitter
Twitter uses a microservices architecture to handle tweets, timelines, and notifications. It leverages Kafka for real-time event processing.

3. Instagram
Instagram stores media in Amazon S3 and uses CDNs to deliver content globally. It also employs caching to optimize performance.

Conclusion
Designing a social media platform involves addressing challenges related to scalability, performance, and user experience. By leveraging a hybrid architecture that integrates SQL and NoSQL databases, you can build a robust system capable of handling millions of users and billions of interactions.
